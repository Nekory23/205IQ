# 205IQ
{EPITECH} | Second year | Math project

Most of the reference curves, such as weight and height cruves, are created using Gaussian distributions.
These curves appear to correctly describe “normality”, and that is why the Gaussian distribution is also called normal distribution. A normal distribution is described by its mean value μ and standard deviation σ with the following probability density function.

IQ tests are calibrated so that the results follow a normal distribution. 
The interpretation of the resulting IQ obviously depends on the calibration of the test. Most of the time, the mean is equal to 100. The standard deviation is usually 15 but can vary (24 in the Cattell test, for example). IQ values are always between 0 and 200.

Your psychiatrist, Dr Von Humleit, plans to create his own IQ test, which is supposed to be better suited to the current population than the classical tests from previous centuries. To help him calibrate his test, you have to program the following tasks:
 - given μ and σ, plot the density function of the IQ for every integer between 0 and 200,
 - given μ, σ and one IQ value, print the percentage of people with an IQ inferior to this value,
 - given μ, σ and two IQ values, print the percentage of people with an IQ in between those values.
